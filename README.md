# Eat Da Burger!
A Burger Eatin' Application With MySQL/Node.js/Express/Handlebars/ORM

## Description

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. This also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is added as *available* on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
